* This application is a clock timer that is based on the concept of the Pomodoro technique.

* In this application we have to set two kinds of timings. One is the session time and the other is the break time period. Both these time intervals would occur repetitively in the clock in an alternating fashion.

* It was developed during the freeCodeCamp front end web development certification course.

* You can use the application from the link given below.
