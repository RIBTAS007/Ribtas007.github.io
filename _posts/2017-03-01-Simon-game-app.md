* This is the [Simon game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_(game)) app.

* The app creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over.

* It was developed during the freeCodeCamp front end web development certification course.

* Play the game from the link given below.
