* This application as the name implies is a tiffin service application.

* We can place orders according to the menu available during that duration of time, i.e., in day time it will show a different menu and in the afternoon time, the menu shown would be different.

* This application was developed by me and one of my friends in mid-semester break during my college days.

* You can use the app from the link given below. ( Note:-  it is just a demo version, all features will not work. )
